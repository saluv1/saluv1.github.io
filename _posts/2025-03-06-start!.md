First of all, I'll write down all posts in english. cuz In this system(github.io), there should be extra program of method to type korean on post.
I'm kind of lazy right now. so, I'll fix this problem someday, I guess.

These days, I'm deeping into problem solving(in baekjoon) and I will study AI, robotics ,if I finish my exams(Teps, Tesat), from next month 
So, If you are interested in these realms, it will be very helpful to you!!

Currently, I finished reading Deep Learning from scratch.[^1] 
           I'm studying introduction of robotics(Frank park)
           I solved about 380 problems in baekjoon

My 3 different kind of postings are as follows.
1. Reviewing problems I've solved in baekjoon, codeforce.
2. Reviewing books and papers on DL,RL, vision models, etc. 
3. Reviewing what I learned from Introduction of robotics and control systems engineering

Although my status is ROKAF's subordinate, but I'll keep going!!
